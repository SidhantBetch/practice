# 🎡 Unique Paths II

You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

 

### 📚 Example 1:

```text
S 0 0
0 X 0
0 0 E
```

    Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
    Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

### 📚 Example 2:

```text
S →
0 ↓
0 →
```


    Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
    Output: 1
 

## 🍟 Constraints:
- m == obstacleGrid.length
- n == obstacleGrid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.

# 🤦🏻 Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(obstacleGrid)
        n = len(obstacleGrid[0])

        memo = {}

        def dfs(row, col):

            if row >= m or col >= n:
                return 0

            if obstacleGrid[row][col] == 1:
                return 0

            if row == m - 1 and col == n - 1:
                return 1

            if (row, col) in memo:
                return memo[(row, col)]

            memo[(row, col)] = (
                dfs(row + 1, col) +
                dfs(row, col + 1)
            )

            return memo[(row, col)]

        return dfs(0, 0)
```
